# Chris's dotfiles

Dotfiles for all my Linux boxes.

# How to Use

Clone this repository anywhere on your filesystem. Then run the `bootstrap.sh` script, which will copy all of the dotfiles to your home directory.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Ludachrispeed/dotfiles.git
```

## Thanks

[Mathias Bynens](http://mathiasbynens.be) for his popular [dotfiles](http://mths.be/dotfiles) project. I've shamelessly taken his `bootstrap.sh` as well as several nuggets of bash.
