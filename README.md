# Chris's dotfiles

Dotfiles for all my Linux boxes.

## How to Use

Clone this repository anywhere on your filesystem. A folder called "dotfiles" will be automatically created after you clone the ropository. Then `cd` into the new "dotfiles" folder and execute the `bootstrap.sh` script, which will copy all of the dotfiles into your home directory (overwriting existing files).

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Ludachrispeed/dotfiles.git
```

## Thanks

[Mathias Bynens](http://mathiasbynens.be) for his popular [dotfiles](http://mths.be/dotfiles) project. I've shamelessly taken his `bootstrap.sh` as well as several nuggets of bash.
